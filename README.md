# AI Coding Examples

This repository contains AI-generated source code examples created using [Beyond Python SmoLAgents](https://github.com/joaopauloschuler/beyond-python-smolagents).

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:
- **Storage**: Preserve AI-generated code examples for reference and documentation
- **Comparison**: Enable future analysis and comparison of AI coding results across different:
  - Programming languages
  - AI models
  - Problem-solving approaches
  - Time periods

## Repository Structure

The repository organizes code examples by programming language:

```
src/
├── free-pascal/
│   └── task-manager/
├── php/
│   └── task-manager/
└── [other languages]/
```

Each example includes:
- Complete source code implementations
- Documentation and usage guides
- AI-generated metadata (where applicable)

## About the Code Generation
